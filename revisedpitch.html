<h1 style="text-align: center;"> How Are Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) Changing New York City?</h1>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">  Under former Mayor Bloomberg, the last decade has seen a sharp increase in the formation of Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) in New York City. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">  Supporters of BIDs promote it as a way for local shops and restaurants to band together to bring more business to their area. By pooling resources, they can pay for extra street cleaning, trash removal, and holiday decorations and throw neighborhood events that draw in more customers. </p> 

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> But others say that creating a BID is just a fast-track to gentrification, cleaning out the mom-and-pop shops who can't afford the increases in dues and rents, paving the way for commerical chains. The rise of the BIDs coincides with Bloomberg-era gentrification and is simply a way of privatizing public spaces, they say. Additionally, BIDs often force small business owners to pay for services the city should already be providing with tax dollars, like security and sanitation. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> In Jackson Heights, a neighborhood of Mexicans, Columbians, and South Asians, a proposed bid has drawn controversy. Marty Kirchener, an activist with Roosevelt Avenue Community Alliance argues that it will drive up prices and push out the immmigrant cpmmunity of the neighborhood. "This is what BID is about," he said."Replacing one population, a working class immigrant population, with an urban professional population looking for new areas to find more affordable housing than they can find in Manhattan and Brooklyn.” </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> Marty rails against the way BIDs change the public spaces of neighborhoods, moving them into the private sphere. Is there truth in what Marty says? BID supporters counter that by cleaning up neighborhoods, BIDs provides a better shopping experience for customers and brings profits to shop-owners – a win-win.  </p>

 <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> What does the data show? </p>

 <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> This project proposes to decode how Business Improvement Districts in New York have been changing the city's neighborhoods – for better or for worse - and to investigate the role they may play in fast-tracking gentrification. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> 1. The first step will be to make a map that shows where the BIDS are located and a table of which types of businesses are a part of them (better than this <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/html/neighborhood_development/bid_directory.shtml">one</a> ). </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> 2. Then, I'll ook at BIDs over time- when were these BIDS established? Was there a time when creating BIDS ramped up? How have the neighborhoods changed since?  What kinds of shops existed and what shops exist now? Have they changed differently than the neighborhoods without BIDs or their surrounding neighborhoods? </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> 3. Compare budgets of BIDS – categorized from under $25,000 to above $5 million. How much do shop-owners have to pay and what do they get in return? What are the BIDs spending money on? How much does the city subsidize the BIDs? Are some more subsidized than others? </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> 4. Compare what BIDs pay for that overlaps with the city – such as sanitation and security. Many argue that taxes already pay for this - shoulnd't the city be taking care of it? How much more are they supplementing to what the city already pays? </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> For the human part of this story, I will do a deep dive into a couple different areas that have BIDs, based on what the data shows - for example perhaps I'll take the lowest-funded BID and the highest funded, or the one that spends a huge amount on security, compared to the others. Then I'll use Jackson Heights, an area that has been in the process of <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140725/jackson-heights/planned-business-improvement-district-loses-support-of-major-advocacy-group">deciding</a>  if it wants to create a BID or not. I’d like to include video profiles of shop owners and shoppers for this too. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> The data I can get might be a bit complicated, which is probably why no one has looked at this in-depth before. This NYC.gov <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/html/neighborhood_development/bid_directory.shtml?show=boro">website</a> has listings of each BID and some basic info like their “assessment” and the year it was created. But then each BID has it’s own personal website with more  specific info, like listings of the companies, sometimes financial reports etc. Each BID has their files in their own different format, so this will be a big project in learning how to compile and clean different data. I will also learn how to make an interactive map and various graphs. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> This is newsworthy because it's a different angle on  the gentrifaction/city changing topic many people are following. We often look at developers and land-zoning issues when we talk about gentrification, but the way BIDs aid the gentrification process is subtler, and an important piece of the puzzle. I could pitch this to any New York centric publication: NY Times, NY Magazine, DNA Info, Metro, WNYC etc.
