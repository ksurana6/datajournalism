  										  	<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> Have you ever heard of a Business Improvement District (BID)? As a resident of New York and a shopper, do you know what a BID does, why it exists and how it changes a neighborhood? If you were a shop-owner, would you want to be part of one or not?  There are 67 of them in New York City, investing close to 100 million dollars annually into programs and services, and they shape our experiences in this city more than you would expect. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> In Jackson Heights, a proposed bid has drawn controversy. Marty Kirchener, an activist with Roosevelt Avenue Community Alliance, is against it, arguing that it will drive up prices and irrevocably change the Latino roots of the neighborhood. He says, “this is what BID is about: replacing one population, a working class immigrant population, with an urban professional population looking for new areas to find more affordable housing than they can find in Manhattan and Brooklyn.” </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> Marty rails against the way BIDs change the public spaces of neighborhoods, moving them into the private sphere. Is there truth in what Marty says? BID supporters counter that it cleans up neighborhoods, provides a better shopping experience for customers and brings profits to shop-owners – a win-win. Can this be shown through data? </p>

 <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> This project proposes to decode what a Business Improvement District in New York means and how it actually changes a neighborhood – for better or for worse. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> 1. The first step will be to make a map that shows where the BIDS are located and which businesses are a part of them (better than this <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/html/neighborhood_development/bid_directory.shtml">one</a> ). </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> 2. Then, to look at BIDs over time- when were these BIDS established? Was there a time when creating BIDS ramped up? How have the neighborhoods changed since? Have they changed differently than the neighborhoods without BIDs? </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> 3. Compare budgets of BIDS – categorized from under $25,000 to above $5 million. How much do shop-owners have to pay and what do they get in return? What are the BIDs spending money on? How much does the city subsidize the BIDs? Are some more subsidized than others? </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> 4. Compare what BIDs pay for that overlaps with the city – such as sanitation and security. Many argue that taxes already pay for this - shoulnd't the city be taking care of it? How much more are they supplementing to what the city already pays? </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> For the human part of this story, I will do a deep dive into a couple different areas that have BIDs (probably 1 in established Manhattan, 1 in gentrifying Brooklyn, 1 in a far-away area, like the Bronx or East Brooklyn) and use Jackson Heights, an area that has been in the process of <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140725/jackson-heights/planned-business-improvement-district-loses-support-of-major-advocacy-group">deciding</a>  if it wants to create a BID or not. I’d like to include video profiles of shop owners and shoppers for this. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> The data I can get might be a bit complicated. This NYC.gov <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/html/neighborhood_development/bid_directory.shtml?show=boro">website</a> has listings of each BID and some basic info like their “assessment” and the year it was created. But then each BID has it’s own personal website with more  specific info, like listings of the companies, sometimes financial reports etc. Each BID has their files in their own format, so this will be a big project in learning how to compile and clean different data. I will also learn how to make an interactive map and various graphs. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> This is newsworthy because it's a different angle on  the gentrifaction/city changing topic many people like to follow. I could pitch this to any New York centric publication: NY Times, NY Magazine, DNA Info, Metro, WNYC etc.

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Visualization of Migration in Europe </h1>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> This project proposes to visualize the unprecedented influx of immigrants/migrants into the EU over the past 23 years and to look at how of the Dublin regulations fuctions. (the Dublin regulations are supposed to regulate asylum applications between member states). The EU is a particularly interesting case because, while the 28-country bloc has become increasingly integrated and has dismantled internal borders, each country has very different policies, experiences and problems in dealing with new migrants and asylum seekers from outside the EU. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> I’ve never seen anything that cohesively brings together different aspects of Europe’s changing multicultural demographics and diverse policies, and the issues that arise because it is a bordered entity without internal borders, yet it is not a unified federation with the same laws. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">This is especially newsworthy because a record number of migrants and refugees arrived to Italy on boats this summer (over 100,000). For the past year, Italy’s Navy has been running a humanitarian rescue operation to save these migrants. Now that the situation has reached such a crisis, the EU is implementing a new border control system in the area, taking over from Italy’s Navy on November 1st. Many wonder if this is a frim step towards unifying Europe's immigration policy </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">But the problem is not just about the border controls – this project seeks to add to the story by integrating data on what happens once migrants are inside the E.U. </p>

 <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">The Dublin regulations are supposed to streamline the asylum process: each migrant is fingerprinted in the first country he/she arrives and that country is responsible for them. Of course, this puts the border countries (Italy, Greece, Spain) at a big disadvantage in handling the requests. Member countries can also request to transfer migrants to other countries, but it seems this doesn’t happen very often. Additionally, different countries have different asylum policies – ex: Germany and Sweden will provide housing and food for refugees, but Italy doesn’t. </p>

 <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">It will be useful to look at: where are new immigrants to the area coming from and where are they moving? Which countries process the most asylum seekers? How often do EU countries transfer asylum seekers among themselves? Can we quantify how much burden each country is sharing? </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> I will use UN <a href="http://esa.un.org/unmigration/TIMSA2013/migrantstocks2013.htm">data</a> of foreign born population in each country (which they call “migrant stock” ) from 1990 and 2013 to make a map visualizing the change. I’m thinking something like you can click on “Senegal” and “1990” to see how many are in each country, and then click on 2013 and see how much it has grown. Even using something like <a href="http://circos.ca/">Circos</a>. It could be interesting, to map out where people came from and where they went. This side of it is more to visualize the magnitude of the change.</p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">Then there could be a separate map showing where asylum seekers are landing (and how many), where they are processed and how they are moving within Europe, based on Dublin Regulation <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Dublin_statistics_on_countries_responsible_for_asylum_application">data</a>. </p>


<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">Then there could be little pop-ups that you click on to find out what policies each country has for migrants and asylum seekers. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">This could be published in a Europe-centric publication like The Guardian data blog, BBC, EuroNews or Linkiesta </p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Thought Experiment on Fancy Cocktails in New York </h1>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">Creative cocktails are about to hit a bubble – New York’s diners have been increasingly enticed by fancy concoctions that use exotic-sounding ingredients like elderflower liquer, jalapeño infused tequila, or black walnut bitters. But NY Times restaurant critic Pete Wells <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/dining/highbrow-house-cocktails-that-aim-too-high.html?_r=0 ">says </a> the hype is getting to be overblown – more and more of those crazy-ingredient-heavy cocktails are overpriced and simply taste bad. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">This project would take a shot at codifying the crazy-cocktail trend and investigate how customers might be fooled by it. It would try to answer: what are the most popular ingredients and cocktail trends? Theoretically, what would it cost to make these cocktails at home? </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">I’ll take a list of 50 top restaurants and scrape their cocktail menus as best as possible to make tables of ingredients, prices and neighborhood. I’ll call them to ask what their most popular cocktails are as well.</p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">Then, using estimates of prices of the ingredients, I will try to figure out which ones offer the best bang for your buck and try to identify cocktail trends that are interesting– for example, if “black walnut bitters” are a one-off unique thing, or if it’s a trend sweeping the cocktail world, and why? Ideally there will be some kind of trend that shows the restaurants are finding new ways to cheat you – like maybe a drink featuring Vodka with rosemary and lemon is dirt-cheap to make, but restaurants have made it sound fancy and they charge $16  (I’m thinking of the current café trend of “smashed avocado toast” – you know that’s gotta cost nothing to make but it sounds really exciting and they charge $8.)</p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> I think this also has the potential to use funny and cute graphics, like it could be categorized by types of cocktail (highball, martini etc) with pictures of the type of glass. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">There won’t really be a human part except I could write a funny first person article of my experiences with good and bad cocktails. </p>

<p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9">
This could be pitched to any New York publication - NY times, NY Mag, Time Out NY etc (I think Bedford and Bowery would definitely take it if I switched it to focus on the neighborhoods they cover) </p>
  										 <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb074d9"> Have you ever heard of a BID? As a resident of New York and a shopper, do you know what a BID does, why it exists and how it changes a neighborhood? If you were a shop-owner, would you want to be part of one or not?  There are 67 of them in New York City, investing close to 100 million dollars annually into programs and services, and they shape our experiences in this city more than you would expect.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07587">  The answers are cataloged. Then, a few days later, the contestant is brought back to go through the questions once more, this time before a studio audience. The answers given are compared to the results of the polygraph, and for each truthful response, the contestant wins money. If she lies &mdash;&thinsp;or rather, if the polygraph says she lies &mdash;&thinsp;she loses it all. Naturally, the more money at stake, the more compromising the questions become. The contestant has the option of calling it off after each answer.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07630">  In Peru, the show&rsquo;s host was Beto Ortiz, who in a recent national poll was named the country&rsquo;s most powerful TV journalist. A balding, heavyset man in his mid-40s, Beto has long been one of the more successful and controversial figures in Peru. He is sharp, inquisitive, funny, and has gained millions of fans; the television critic Fernando Vivas, who writes for <em>El Comercio</em>, Peru&rsquo;s most influential newspaper, described Beto as &ldquo;a monster on the scene, with all the ambivalence implied by the word &lsquo;<em>monster</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  										 
  										  <img src= "http://www.ecohealthypets.com/writable/pet_report_photos/photo/480x/squirrel_monkey_1.jpg" >

  										   <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb076d9">  When Beto first made the transition from print to television, he was known for his deeply reported stories about the seedier aspects of urban life: street kids, punks, prostitutes. He was unlike anyone else on the air. Today, in Lima, you need only say &ldquo;Beto,&rdquo; and everyone knows whom you&rsquo;re talking about. When asked what it was like being famous, Beto responded: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like asking me what it&rsquo;s like being fat. I don&rsquo;t remember what it was like being skinny.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07782">  The show&rsquo;s first contestant was a young woman named Ruth Thal&iacute;a Sayas S&aacute;nchez. She was 19 years old, with shoulder-length brown hair and an easy smile. She and her siblings were born in the province of Huancavelica, hundreds of miles from Lima, but had been raised on the outskirts of the capital in a working-class area called Huachipa. Not long ago, this area was a provincial escape from Lima&rsquo;s humid, miserable winters, but by the time the Sayas S&aacute;nchez family moved in, the neighborhood was in the midst of an unseemly transition, away from its agricultural past and toward its frenetic, urban future. And so both ways of life coexisted, sometimes uneasily: Young men tended to mototaxis; slightly older men grazed horses. Stray dogs lapped water from dirty puddles in the middle of rutted, unpaved roads, and large plots of farmland sat amid half-built houses, rebar poking out of the concrete, piles of bricks lying in the street.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0782a">  This was where Ruth Thal&iacute;a grew up, though she would admit to Beto that she longed for something better. For his part, Beto was, at least initially, unimpressed with Ruth Thal&iacute;a: &ldquo;Average,&rdquo; he said, when asked to describe his first contestant. &ldquo;Pretty, but nothing special.&rdquo; When the cameras began to roll, however, something changed. Ruth Thal&iacute;a brightened, carrying herself with the confidence of a young striver, comfortable under the lights, even playful. &ldquo;She liked being on television,&rdquo; her sister, Eva, would say later.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb078d3">  According to the rules of the program, every contestant could bring three guests. Ruth Thal&iacute;a was accompanied by her parents, Leoncio and Vilma. Leoncio seemed worried from the outset. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of what I might learn about my daughter,&rdquo; he told Beto when he was introduced on camera. Vilma was more optimistic. She was a small woman, with a wide smile and glowing light-brown skin. Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s parents had an Andean pop band, <em>Vilma S&aacute;nchez y los Chupachichis del Per&uacute;</em>, that often performed in the dustier sections of the capital. Vilma sang, and Leoncio played the harp. As far as Vilma knew &mdash;&thinsp;as far as her daughter had told her &mdash;&thinsp;Beto would be asking about her arrival in Lima; about how the family had survived those first years in the capital, selling watermelon and pineapple in the market; about those days when the girls still spoke only Quechua, one of Peru&rsquo;s indigenous languages, and were bullied at school for it. These were satisfying memories for Vilma. They&rsquo;d worked hard, through difficult circumstances, and though they would never have a lot of money, their two daughters were studying at a local university. It&rsquo;s the typical, heroic story of Lima&rsquo;s hundreds of thousands of migrants, no less admirable for being common. &ldquo;I was happy to go,&rdquo; Vilma said later. &ldquo;I was going to say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m from Huancavelica and proud of it, Mr. Beto!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0797d">  Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s third guest was a handsome, timid young man named Bryan Romero Leiva. He wore his brown hair short and combed forward slightly. He was 20 years old, drove a mototaxi, and had been raised on a steeply sloping dirt road near Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s home. He had soccer posters adorning the walls of his old room just off the dirt-floor kitchen, and he kept a cat and a rabbit as pets, both black, as was his preference. He wasn&rsquo;t a dour or unpleasant boy, though; in fact, Bryan&rsquo;s mother, Mery, described her son as helpful and kind. And he hadn&rsquo;t had it easy, that was for sure. He&rsquo;d stuttered, Mery said, ever since an old boyfriend of hers had pushed him down the stairs when the child was only 8. For years, Bryan had accompanied her to the market at dawn, helping her sell breakfast plates to the workers. At the time of the taping, he was renting a room in the neighborhood, just a few minutes&rsquo; walk from his mother&rsquo;s house.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07a26">  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; said Vilma, &ldquo;but I hated that kid.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07acf">  On the show, in front of the cameras, Bryan was tense, his right leg shaking anxiously.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07b78">  &ldquo;You seem nervous,&rdquo; Beto said. &ldquo;What are you so nervous about?&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07c22">  &ldquo;That she may have cheated on me.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07cca">  Everyone laughed, including Ruth Thal&iacute;a.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07d72">  Beto paused. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not forget this is just a game,&rdquo; he said.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07e1a">  The show&rsquo;s opening questions were light: Have you ever skipped school without your mother&rsquo;s knowledge? If you found 1,000 soles, would you return them? Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s parents joked along with Beto, as their daughter copped to these minor moral failings. There was more, of course. David Novoa, who was a producer with the show at the time, later admitted he felt bad. He&rsquo;d done the initial interview with Ruth Thal&iacute;a, had helped Beto formulate the questions that would be part of the show. He&rsquo;d visited the Sayas S&aacute;nchez family in Huachipa and knew their story well. The afternoon of the taping, he was in the control booth, whispering into Beto&rsquo;s earpiece. &ldquo;I knew it was going to be a surprise, and a shameful moment for them.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07ec3">  Which made Ruth Thal&iacute;a a perfect contestant for <em>El Valor de la Verdad</em>. It all happened in a matter of minutes, a kind of onslaught. Ruth Thal&iacute;a revealed that she&rsquo;d had a nose job, that she didn&rsquo;t like her body, that she wished she were white, that she was only with her boyfriend until someone better came along, that she was ashamed of her parents&rsquo; manners, that she didn&rsquo;t work at a call center, that she danced at a nightclub. The result was undeniably riveting: this young, reckless woman sharing secrets with an entire country.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb07f6b">  Reality television was relatively new on Peruvian airwaves. Peru&rsquo;s economic growth in recent years had led to growing advertisement dollars for local television stations and growing budgets for bigger and more ambitious productions. For the region, however, Peru was still catching up. Formats like <em>Big Brother</em>, which had exploded across Latin America, skipped Peru for years. Importing an international format like <em>El Valor de la Verdad</em> would have been unthinkable until quite recently, and audiences were understandably drawn to shows like these. While Ruth Thal&iacute;a answered Beto&rsquo;s questions, her parents and boyfriend sat onstage. Over the course of the hour, they crumbled. Vilma all but begged her daughter to stop. Bryan was too stunned to offer much resistance, never stringing together more than a couple of sentences. At one point, he admitted he loved Ruth Thal&iacute;a. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear more,&rdquo; he said.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08013">  She went on anyway. Beto asked Ruth Thal&iacute;a if she thought Bryan was handsome.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb080bc">  &ldquo;Uh &hellip; yes,&rdquo; she said, hedging a bit.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08164">  &ldquo;And is he smart?&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0820e">  She laughed. &ldquo;More or less.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb082b8">  &ldquo;Does he have a good heart?&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0835f">  For this response, at least, she didn&rsquo;t vacillate: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ruth Thal&iacute;a said, and the studio audience applauded.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08407">  Then came question number 18: Have you ever accepted money for sex?</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb084af">  Vilma bent over, as if in physical pain.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08556">  Ruth Thal&iacute;a answered yes, and the show&rsquo;s announcer, a disembodied, almost robotically precise woman&rsquo;s voice, called out:</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb085fe">  &ldquo;The answer is &hellip; true.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb086a5">  There was a long silence.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0874e">  &ldquo;Just twice,&rdquo; Ruth Thal&iacute;a explained. &ldquo;We needed money. We were in a bad situation. It hasn&rsquo;t happened since, and it won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb087f6">  For this truthful admission, Ruth Thal&iacute;a had won 15,000 soles, or about $5,300 &mdash;&thinsp;almost ten months&rsquo; wages for someone living in Lima. Beto asked if she wanted to go on, in search of 50,000 soles. Before responding, Ruth Thal&iacute;a said she was sorry for all this. &ldquo;My mother, my father, my brother and sister are the most beautiful thing in the world to me. I love them with all my heart. Bryan, forgive me for making you go through this.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0889e">  Then she announced she was done. The audience cheered her decision.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08946">  &ldquo;The truth is always illuminating,&rdquo; Beto said to the cameras. &ldquo;It will not do harm, even though it hurts.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb089ee">  Ruth Thal&iacute;a hugged Bryan. His face registered nothing. As the credits rolled, she got down on her knees before her ashen-faced mother and begged for forgiveness.</p>  </div>  <!-- /.txt-wrapper --></section>  <!-- /.copy -->  <section class="copy">  <div class="txt-wrapper" data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0b785">  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08a95">  <span class="cas-first-words">The show was</span> taped in June and aired a month later, on Saturday, July 12, 2012. That month of waiting wasn&rsquo;t an easy one. Something had been shattered in the Sayas S&aacute;nchez family. Vilma was moody and confused; Leoncio was distant. They couldn&rsquo;t understand why their daughter had done the show. When Vilma asked, Ruth Thal&iacute;a was almost flippant.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08b3d">  &ldquo;For the money,&rdquo; she said.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08be5">  She had fantasized about being famous, to be sure, and had even auditioned for soap operas and other game shows &mdash;&thinsp;but her more immediate goal was practical. She wanted to open a salon. She&rsquo;d already saved the equivalent of $7,000, and the winnings from the show brought her closer to that dream. If she had to make a spectacle of herself, perhaps this was the price to be paid.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08c8d">  Once the show aired, that position became harder to justify. <em>El Valor de la Verdad</em> was an instant success, knocking one of Peru&rsquo;s television icons, Gisela Valc&aacute;rcel, from her No. 1 spot. In fact, for the next 18 weeks that it aired, <em>El Valor de la Verdad</em> would win the ratings battle against Gisela 15 times. Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s secrets were suddenly part of the national conversation. &ldquo;It was a celebration,&rdquo; said producer David Novoa. &ldquo;We beat Gisela. That&rsquo;s all that mattered. The ratings! They were drinking champagne up on the second floor&rdquo; &mdash;&thinsp;the executive offices at the station, Frecuencia Latina. Ruth Thal&iacute;a was the face of Beto&rsquo;s new hit show. She was photographed with a Frecuencia Latina executive, grinning and holding one of those oversize checks, and splashed on the cover of newspapers across the capital.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08d35">  Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s notoriety, though, had come at a great cost. &ldquo;This neighborhood we live in is a hellhole of gossip,&rdquo; Leoncio said. It seemed everyone had seen Ruth Thal&iacute;a on the show, and everyone had an opinion. Relatives the family hadn&rsquo;t heard from in years were calling to say how ashamed they were. Ruth Thal&iacute;a withdrew. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even want to leave the house,&rdquo; Eva said. Ruth Thal&iacute;a confessed to her mother that she&rsquo;d thought of suicide.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08ddd">  For Bryan, one could argue, it was even worse. He&rsquo;d been exposed as a cuckold in front of millions, something unforgivable in Peru&rsquo;s macho culture. One day, at the bridge in Huachipa, Bryan was taunted by a busload of high school students. He had to go hide in a nearby store. In the weeks after the airing, he showed up at the station a few times, demanding some kind of recompense for his public humiliation. He was accompanied by his uncle, Redy Leiva, who was studying law and did most of the talking.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08e84">  One afternoon, just a few weeks after the show had aired, a television crew from Frecuencia Latina caught up with Bryan at the front door of his house. The host asked him how he felt.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08f2c">  &ldquo;Ashamed. All the things I learned on that show,&rdquo; Bryan said, eyes avoiding the camera. &ldquo;How would you feel?&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb08fd4">  &ldquo;But they say that if you love someone, you can forgive them.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0907b">  &ldquo;Depends what they did. The things she said that day, I can&rsquo;t forgive.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09123">  In other interviews, Bryan claimed that it had all been a setup. He and Ruth Thal&iacute;a had broken up months before the taping. She&rsquo;d approached him and asked him for a favor. Pretend to be my boyfriend on television, she&rsquo;d said, and if I win, I&rsquo;ll share the money with you. He&rsquo;d agreed, with no idea what he was getting into. It had been an ambush. Weeks had passed, and he still hadn&rsquo;t seen a cent. Then he went further: The producers of the show had known all along that he and Ruth Thal&iacute;a weren&rsquo;t together. Frecuencia Latina was complicit in the charade.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb091cf">  &ldquo;After the show,&rdquo; Eva said, &ldquo;he started asking for money. First 500, then 1,000, then 2,000.&rdquo; One day, someone broke into the Sayas S&aacute;nchez house and stole Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s laptop. None of Eva&rsquo;s things was taken. The family assumed that Bryan had stolen it, but he denied it, and in the end, there was no proof. Leoncio filed a police report, and that was that.</p>  </div>  <!-- /.txt-wrapper --></section>  <!-- /.copy -->  <section class="copy">  <div class="txt-wrapper" data-atavist-id="at542cf9c3ee3a2">  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09279">  <span class="cas-first-words">On September 11, 2012,</span> eight weeks after <em>El Valor de la Verdad</em> debuted, Leoncio and Vilma went to bed watching a World Cup qualifying match between Peru and Argentina. When they woke up, Leoncio heard his wife say, &ldquo;Thal&iacute;a hasn&rsquo;t come home.&rdquo; Ruth Thal&iacute;a had never done this before. Eva was out of town, but eventually, they were able to contact her. She called some of her sister&rsquo;s friends and managed to reach a young man who&rsquo;d seen Ruth Thal&iacute;a the night before as she left the university. He said she&rsquo;d gotten a call from Bryan. Vilma went straight to Bryan&rsquo;s house for answers. She feared the worst. &ldquo;I was crying, screaming,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everyone in the street, the neighbors, they must have seen me. I was kneeling, as if he were a god. Bryan, give me back Thal&iacute;a.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09322">  But Bryan was unmoved. He said he hadn&rsquo;t spoken to her in a while, and then he turned and went inside.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb093cb">  When faced with a situation like this one, people like the Sayas S&aacute;nchez family don&rsquo;t have a lot of options. This is a fact of life in Peru, though not just there, of course. If you&rsquo;re poor, if you come from a place like Huachipa, the authorities aren&rsquo;t always on your side. The police can be slow to react, even negligent, and corruption weighs most heavily on those least able to withstand it. Leoncio filed a missing persons report on September 12, 2012, without much hope. Then he went to the one place where he felt he had a chance to be heard: to Frecuencia Latina, the station that had aired <em>El Valor de la Verdad</em>.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09473">  &ldquo;Here in the city,&rdquo; Leoncio said later, &ldquo;the only way to get help is through the media. Where else can you go?&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0951b">  The studios of Frecuencia Latina sit behind a high green wall in a residential neighborhood of the city called Jes&uacute;s Mar&iacute;a, and look more like a military bunker than a television station. Still, on any given day, at any given hour, there are mobs of young fans out front, hoping to catch a peek of their idols or get picked to be in the audience at their favorite show. There&rsquo;s another crowd, too, often older than the fans, people like Leoncio, who&rsquo;ve come to the television station for help. Supplicants. They press their documents against the mirrored glass security window; they stammer their sad stories and ask to speak to a producer. They&rsquo;ve suffered one of the many indignities that life in a city like Lima can deal to a person: They need work; they&rsquo;ve been swindled; they have a sick child and no hope of access to health care. From a turret above the scene, a guard stands watch.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb095c4">  Leoncio was fortunate: He was able to speak to a producer from Beto&rsquo;s morning news show, <em>Abre los Ojos</em>, who promised to get them on the air the next day, to publicize their plight.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0966c">  When Leoncio got home, he found Vilma in anguish. He did what he could to calm her. They talked for a while, speculating where their daughter might be, trying not to fall into despair. Maybe she&rsquo;d gone on a trip. Maybe someone had drugged her or was holding her for ransom. That night, Leoncio and Vilma didn&rsquo;t sleep. Tomorrow, they hoped, after their daughter&rsquo;s disappearance was made known, the search for her would begin in earnest.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09715">  The next morning at 5:00 a.m., the phone rang. It was the producer from <em>Abre los Ojos</em>. She was apologetic: Their appearance had been canceled. A problem with scheduling, she said, and promised to call again soon.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb097bd">  Three days passed, and no one from Frecuencia Latina had called. There was still no sign of Ruth Thal&iacute;a, and the police hadn&rsquo;t done much investigating. Vilma and Leoncio went out every morning, asking for help at all the television stations in Lima, with no results. During those first anxious days, while Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s parents visited the local television stations, they never mentioned <em>El Valor de la Verdad </em>or Beto Ortiz. They were omitting the most crucial and valuable detail: that their daughter was famous. Or infamous. Instead, they told a simpler version of events. Our daughter hasn&rsquo;t come home. We&rsquo;re poor people, and we need help.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09867">  It&rsquo;s a story, incidentally, that is heard every day at the door of every television station in Peru.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09910">  On the third day, at Channel 9, also called <acronym>ATV</acronym>, Vilma finally shared the key piece of information that would once more land her daughter on the front pages of newspapers all over the country. &ldquo;I explained it to the man,&rdquo; Vilma said, referring to the security guard at <acronym>ATV</acronym>. &ldquo;I said, my daughter, she was the girl from <em>El Valor de la Verdad</em>. Right away he went to get the cameraman.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb099b9">  That night, three days after Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s disappearance, the case was mentioned for the first time on national television. Vilma happened to be watching <acronym>ATV</acronym> while she waited to speak to a detective at police headquarters in downtown Lima. &ldquo;I was sitting there, and on the television, I hear Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s name, and I thought: Sweet Lord, for sure I&rsquo;ll find my daughter now!&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09a63">  There was only one problem: <acronym>ATV</acronym> didn&rsquo;t introduce Ruth Thal&iacute;a as &ldquo;the girl from <em>El Valor de la Verdad</em>.&rdquo; Instead, the host called her &ldquo;the prostitute from <em>El Valor de la Verdad</em>.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09b0c">  &ldquo;They killed me in my heart,&rdquo; Vilma said.</p>  <!-- /.txt-wrapper --></div>  </section>  <!-- /.copy -->

  <section class="copy">  <div class="txt-wrapper" data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0b82e">  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09bb4">  <span class="cas-first-words">Now the story</span> had changed. This was no longer about the disappearance of a young woman from a faraway neighborhood of the sprawling capital. Everyone wanted exclusive access to Ruth Thal&iacute;a&rsquo;s family, and Vilma, Leoncio, and Eva found themselves under siege. Every station in Lima sent producers and cameramen to the family home in Huachipa. They took long panning shots of the unpaved street, the train tracks, the mototaxis. They talked to neighbors and passers-by and hounded Vilma and Leoncio wherever they went.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09c5e">  When stories like these happen in Lima, the competition between the various channels can be brutal. Every television news program &mdash;&thinsp;and there are dozens &mdash;&thinsp;peddles a steady diet of crime reporting. The morning news shows recount the overnight death toll from shootings, robberies gone awry, kidnappings, domestic disputes that escalate into violence. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for the producers of a news show to buy their way into a wake, offering grieving families DVD players and stereos for exclusive shots of the tearful mother or the mourning husband. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tradition in Peruvian journalism, not a good one, in my opinion,&rdquo; explained Maribel Toledo, a journalist with more than 15 years of experience working in television. &ldquo;In order to secure exclusives, the reporters, the stations, the producers grab people and almost kidnap them.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09d07">  Every news program in Lima aired a story on Ruth Thal&iacute;a, but <acronym>ATV</acronym> had the family. By the sixth day, Leoncio recalled, &ldquo;<acronym>ATV</acronym> was here all the time. They even slept here. They wouldn&rsquo;t leave us alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09db1">  Leoncio and Vilma got up each morning to ask for help. This task &mdash;&thinsp;knocking on doors, hoping someone might listen &mdash;&thinsp;constituted the entirety of their lives in those days. They traveled in a car provided by <acronym>ATV</acronym>, filmed by <acronym>ATV</acronym> cameramen. They went to the Ministry of Women&rsquo;s Affairs, to police headquarters, to the hospitals, to the morgue. They knocked on the door of the presidential palace in central Lima and managed to get an audience with an adviser to the first lady. A phone call from the palace got some movement out of the police. Things were happening, and to be fair, for people like Leoncio and Vilma, much of this would&rsquo;ve been impossible without the help of a station like <acronym>ATV</acronym>. Leoncio was uneasy with the situation, but he knew there was no other way.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09e5b">  Leoncio didn&rsquo;t eat; Vilma didn&rsquo;t sleep. They received all kinds of terrifying phone calls, including extortion attempts traced to police officers in towns outside Lima, claiming they had a lead but needed money to investigate. One day, Leoncio recounted, &ldquo;a mototaxi driver came and said, &lsquo;You know what? I found your daughter.&rsquo;&rdquo; According to this stranger, Ruth Thal&iacute;a was being held in a hotel not far from their home. He would take Leoncio there, for the right price. They negotiated and agreed on 2,000 soles, half upfront. Leoncio felt he had no choice, but he was afraid. He climbed onto the man&rsquo;s mototaxi, and they headed toward an area called Carapongo. When they arrived at the hotel, the man told him to wait, and Leoncio was left alone. &ldquo;I called Channel 9. I just let it ring a couple of times. In case I disappeared, too, my last call would be from there.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09f05">  A few minutes later, the mototaxi driver brought down a young woman, but it wasn&rsquo;t Ruth Thal&iacute;a, just another girl, a runaway, who looked like her. Leoncio was crushed. &ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; he told the girl, and she started crying. &ldquo;Those were desperate days,&rdquo; he later recalled. &ldquo;I felt like I was floating. There were moments where I couldn&rsquo;t tell if I was asleep or awake.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb09faf">  By then it had been a week since Ruth Thal&iacute;a had disappeared. The police and, crucially, the media knew that Bryan had been the last one to speak to her. On the morning of September 22, he was interviewed by Alejandra Puente, a reporter from <acronym>ATV</acronym>. When asked if he&rsquo;d seen Ruth Thal&iacute;a on the night in question, Bryan said he couldn&rsquo;t remember. He&rsquo;d been drunk.</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0a059">  The reporter pushed him: &ldquo;If you were me, would you believe yourself?&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0a103">  &ldquo;Like I said, I don&rsquo;t remember that day.&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0a1b0">  &ldquo;But your conscience is clean?&rdquo;</p>  <p data-atavist-id="at5428cdfb0a25a">  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bryan said.</p>  </div>  <!-- /.txt-wrapper --></section>  <!-- /.copy -->
