<h1> Most asylum-seekers in the EU aren't allowed to stay, but that doesn't mean they go home. </h1>


<p> This past summer almost 200,000 people crossed the Mediterranean from North Africa to reach Italy's shores. While some take the trip hoping for better economic opportunities, many of the newcomers are fleeing war and violence in their home countries. The UN High Commission on Refugees estimates that 25% of the arrivals were from war-torn Syria, and another 25% fled the oppresive military dictatorship in Eritrea. </p>
 
 (notes In 2013 there were 398,234 asylum applications and 326,585 asylum application decisions. 48,000 people arrived to Italy, but 27,832 applied for asylum. Not direct correlation but shows something is up)

<p>But how is Europe handling the influx of asylum seekers? EU countries are obliged to recognize valid claims for asylum under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. As defined by these agreements, a refugee is a person who is outside his or her country of nationality (or place of habitual residence if stateless) who, owing to a fear of persecution on account of a protected ground, is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of the state. Protected grounds include race, nationality, religion, political opinion and membership of a particular social group. The signatories to these agreements are further obliged not to return or "refoul" refugees to the place where they would face persecution.</p>

<p> But how does this work when the 28 countries in the EU rejected 66% of the applications it decided upon last year? </p>

<p> It's interesting to look at the breakdown by country. Some countries, like Germany and France, made decisions on far more applications in 2013</p>

<p> Though more people are applying for asylum, the percentage receiving refugee status isn't really a changing trend - over the past 5 years the numbers have been climbing, but the EU has only begun to accept _% more since 2008 </p>

<p> One explanation that could justify the rejections migh be that far more people are applying for asylum than are really eligible because the system makes it too easy for ineligible people to apply. A look at the data makes that hard to prove. Looking at which nationalities applied in 2013 and how many people were accepted show that 94% of applicants that were decided upon could have come from a top 20 list of nationalities that seek asylum around the world, including Syrians, Iraqis, Russians and Eritreans. </p>

	<p> The following table allows you to look at where each nationality applied for asylum in 2013. It shows some interesting trends. Syrians overwhelmingly are applying for asylum in Sweden, the country with the most generous asylum laws. Meanwhile, Afghanis, Iraqis, Iranians and people from Serbia and Kosovo have a preference for Germany. France receives the most applications from former colony Democratic Republic of the Congo, but not Algeria, and receives more applicants from Bangladesh and Albania than other countries. </p>

		<p> Strangely, Italy comes up as a top destination only for Nigerians. Spain, Greece and Bulgaria barely register in the asylum application numbers. This is interesting because Italy is the primary portal through which migrants and refugees reach Europe. The other border countries, like Spain, Greece and Bulgaria, also receive many migrants. Under EU law, asylum-seekers should be fingerprinted and apply for refugee status in the first EU country they reach. Clearly this is not happening. But why? </p>

		<p> The explanation, said ____[quotes] has to do with many factors. Border countries like Italy, Greece and Spain have borne the brunt of the Eurozone crisis and are ill-equipped to integrate new arrivals with assistance or jobs. Many migrants also go to France, Sweden or Germany for family reunification, language reasons or because they believe they'll have a better chance at getting refugee status. </p>

<p> But why do so many migrants take dangerous boats to enter Europe in the first place? If they are true refugees, can't they apply for protection outside the country? Unfortunately, this seems to be nearly impossible. The EU accepts so few refugees for resettlement that it's nearly impossible - and pretty embarassing next to the US's policy - Take a look at the numbers:

<p> And wat happens to these asylum-seekers once they are rejected? How many people does the EU deport anyway? The data is not separated by migrants and asylum-seekers, but it seems that, though the EU sends out a lot of orders for third country nationals to leave, it can be actually difficult to oblige them to go home. About 40 to 50% are returned each year. <p>
