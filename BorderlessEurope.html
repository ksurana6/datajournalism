My Chinese husband is himself an immigrant, and became a citizen several years ago. I tell my children that they are real Americans. Old and new, blended together, working side by side, taking the best of both to build a new life together.","attribution":"Denise Chang, Castle Rock, Colo."},{"quote":"Being American to me is still getting goose bumps when the national anthem is played.

I laugh more. I greet and talk to complete strangers. I have started reading books again like I used to when I first got out of college. All my vital health indicators are better and under control. I have started treatment to straighten my teeth. I get up earlier. I can walk into a room where I don’t know a soul and come out two hours later having made new connections useful for my business. I exercise regularly including weight training and swimming. I am sexually more active. I get more creative ideas than any time in my life. I drive the golf balls longer and more accurately. I am 49 and I feel like I have just rebooted.","attribution":"Asim Shaikh, Karachi, Pakistan"},{"quote":"To be American is to be accessible in a way that some other cultures aren’t. Today, on the street of my European city, I was asked for help by a French-speaking couple who had a bit of English. I smiled, whipped out my phone, got the answer, and sent them on their way. As they departed, the woman smiled and asked whether I was American. I sensed that she knew already. There must have been something about me (in her eyes). To me, the quick, can-do attitude, the willingness to interject, and the willingness to try is American.","attribution":"Rose, Luxembourg"},{"quote":"To be an American is to dream of better days for you and your family, but acknowledging that your own personal investment of energy and focus, while critical, still may not get you as far as you would like. To be an American is to be proud of your country’s heritage and democracy, but not to be so blind as to swallow it whole. To be an American is to be civil, and to have the principle of civility ever present as you interact with society, individuals, institutions and loved ones.","attribution":"Crash, Baltimore"},{"quote":"As an expat, living in London, I see even more clearly that Americans are open to possibilities, we solve problems, we judge people as people first; we have a spark. At home, we may have to squarely face our own prejudices in a rapidly evolving multicultural America, but fundamentally we don’t believe that limitations of class and race belong in a free and balanced society.","attribution":"AbbeyRoadster, London"},{"quote":"Being American means living in a place where regular citizens have access to every possible freedom, yet we don't get to enjoy them because we work too much just to get by.","attribution":"JCS, New York"}];
