<h1>Explainer on Business Improvement Districts (BID) in New York City.</h1>

<p1> Have you ever heard of a BID? As a resident of New York and a shopper, do you know what a BID does, why it exists and how it changes a neighborhood? If you were a shop-owner, would you want to be part of one or not?  There are 67 of them in New York City, investing close to 100 million dollars annually into programs and services, and they shape our experiences in this city more than you would expect. </p1>

<p2> In Jackson Heights, a proposed bid has drawn controversy. Marty Kirchener, an activist with Roosevelt Avenue Community Alliance, is against it, arguing that it will drive up prices and irrevocably change the Latino roots of the neighborhood. He says, “this is what BID is about: replacing one population, a working class immigrant population, with an urban professional population looking for new areas to find more affordable housing than they can find in Manhattan and Brooklyn.” </p2>

Marty rails against the way BIDs change the public spaces of neighborhoods, moving them into the private sphere. Is there truth in what Marty says? BID supports argue that it cleans up neighborhoods, provides a better shopping experience for customers and brings profits to shop-owners – a win-win. Can this be shown through data?

 This project proposes to decode what a Business Improvement District in New York means and how it actually changes a neighborhood – for better or for worse.   

1. The first step will be to make a map that shows where the BIDS are located and which businesses are a part of them (better than this <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/html/neighborhood_development/bid_directory.shtml">one</a>.

<p3> 2. Then to look at it over time- when were these BIDS established? Was there a time when creating BIDS ramped up? How have the neighborhoods changed since? Have they changed differently than the neighborhoods without BIDs? 

3. Compare budgets of BIDS – categorized from under $25,000 to above $5 million. How much do shop-owners have to pay and what do they get in return? What are the BIDs spending money on

4. Compare what BIDs pay for that overlaps with the city – such as sanitation and security. Shouldn’t the city be paying for this? How much more are they supplementing  what the city already pays? 

For the human part of this story, I will do a deep dive into a couple different areas that have BIDs (probably 1 in established Manhattan, 1 in gentrifying Brooklyn, 1 in a far-away area, like the Bronx) and use Jackson Heights, an area that has been in the process of <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140725/jackson-heights/planned-business-improvement-district-loses-support-of-major-advocacy-group">deciding</a>  if it wants to create a BID or not. I’d like to include video profiles of shop owners and shoppers for this. 

The data I can get might be a bit complicated. This NYC.gov website has listings of each BID and some basic info like their “assessment” and the year it was created. But then each BID has it’s own personal <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/html/neighborhood_development/bid_directory.shtml?show=boro">website</a> with more info like listings of the companies, sometimes financial reports etc. Each BID has their files in their own format, so this will be a big project in learning how to compile and clean different data. I will also learn how to make an interactive map and various graphs. 

I could pitch this to any New York centric publication: NY Times, NY Magazine, DNA Info, Metro, WNYC etc.
