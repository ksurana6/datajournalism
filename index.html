<h1>Since 2005, graduation rates for students in New York City’s public high schools seemed to be on an upward trend. reaching a high of 70 percent in 2010. But numbers plummeted in 2013, when only 62 percent of students left high school with a diploma, less than the 63 percent who graduated in 2005. 

 The schools with the lowest graduating rates were so-called “second chance” transfer schools that try to help graduate students who struggled at previous high schools. Many of these students already have children of their own to care for or are working part time jobs, making it hard for them to focus on graduation. For some of these schools, like Bushwick Community High school, Graduation is as low as 14%. 
 
In contrast, some of the best schools are “early college” high-achieving schools, like Bard High School Early College Queens, or magnet schools like Bronx High School of Science or Stuyvesant High School. 

Best and worst schools are scattered throughout outer boroughs. Both Townsend Harris High School in Queens and Scholars’ Academy in Far Rockaway can boast of
 100% graduating rates. Other top schools include Staten Island Technical High School, Brooklyn Latin School, Millennium High School and Academy for Careers in Television and Film.</h1>
